# TCP-World-Dom

Files are named "mathopoly" but final version was renamed to "World Domination" before launch

Each team is started on one of the .php pages of differing colors (could easily implement a log in system, which is in reality a redirect, and fuddle the URLs to prevent teams from accidentally using another team's page)

Solving problems on the .php page will increase the points on the points sql table from 0 to 1 to 2 and maxes at 3. Once a team reaches 3 points, nobody will receive points for answering questions in 

*could probably have a row with points totalled in sql table for easy calculation of winner
